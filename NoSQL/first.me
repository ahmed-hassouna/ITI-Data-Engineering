📌 Key Characteristics
📐 Fixed Schema
In an RDBMS, data is stored according to a predefined schema (table structure).
Every table has well-defined columns with specific data types.
If new data does not match the existing structure, the schema must first be modified before inserting it.
✅ Example: If we want to store a new field like PhoneNumber for Customers, we must ALTER the table to add a new column.

⚖️ ACID Properties
RDBMS ensures data reliability through ACID properties:
Atomicity → Every transaction is all-or-nothing.
Consistency → The database always moves from one valid state to another.
Isolation → Transactions run independently without interfering with each other.
Durability → Once committed, data is permanently saved, even if the system crashes.
